some code in a browser

this website will include examples of verything I learn and code. Step one is to figure out git so i cna push my saved changes to the repository here. Once that's done I will update my readme a bit and then post my second 100 Days of Code update.

# README.md

### What is this?
This website is:
- an attempt to build something tangible and immediate so I can be motivated not just to become a better coder but to excel and - a - links and examples of other projects, certs, code related stuff
- a growing reflection of my skill as a coder


This README and the basic webpage along with some lessons are what I got done on my second day of 100 days of code. I also started using git inside the terminal of Code OSS (VS Code). I looked back over my github history and saw the bump in commits the last time I tried something like this. This time I've also joined the free code camp Discord and committed to the 100 Days of Code challenge. Setting this website up and updating this README are part of what I did on day 2. I also completed 5-X of the Typography lesson in the FreeCodeCamp Curiculum.
