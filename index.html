    <div><p class="blurb">This simple page contains a regular udpdate post about my coding and is otherwise devoted to my cat. The pictures are very high resolution, they are taken with a 24MP Sony A6300 and I think present a beautiful and adorable side of her. They can be opened in full resolution by right clicking or long pressing image and then choosing to either download/save the image or view it in a new tab in your browser.</p></div>

            **EDIT2**
        <br>
            I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart   about until tomorrow. Brain rest time.

            **EDIT1**
            <br>
            So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

            Day 2/100 - 14/07/24
            <br>
            Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to github!

            <img src="/images/best_pic.JPG" alt="A really nice portrait landscape photo of a cat">
            <div class="caption-bg"><p class="caption">This is a probably the best photo I will ever take. I am low down, she's paused, head raised. Her eyes and nose are beautifullly focused catching her in a candid moment of focus transfixed by the trees above. I love this picture.</p></div>
            <img src="/images/bigstretch.JPG" alt="A photo of a cat just stretching after it gets up from a nap">
            <p class="caption caption-bg">Here she had just woken up and partially stretched up, she turned and in the natural light her messy thick fur just looked very impressive. I couldn't help but take some pictures of her as always. This is one that really makes her look soft.</p>
            <img src="/images/litwell.JPG" alt="A dramatically lit close up photo of a cat">
            <p class="caption caption-bg">Strong backlighting creates this playful shadow across her face here, it accentuates the roundness of her forms in a way that front lighting can't. I had never seen this aspect of her before and luckliy the camera was nearby. So cute <3 </p>
            <img src="/images/hunter.JPG" alt="A picture of a cat looking reminiscent of a large hunting cat">
            <p class="caption caption-bg">In this photo you can clearly see her ancestry as a large hunting animal. Powerful muscles and fully intentioned motion combine to convey a sense of predatory focus. I love this picture of her as it reminds me that no matter how cute I think she is, her kind would menace us dreadfully if they were bigger.</p>
            <img src="/images/lick.JPG" alt="A close up of a cat licking her paw">
            <p class="caption caption-bg">Another very close up portrait shot, this time she playfully reclines in the sunshine licking her paws with carefree indulgence. When the light is good it really brightens her white fur and contrasts the darker patches beautifully. This was another siuation where a candid model and great natural light did all the work.</p>
        <p>Soon there will be a link to my <a href="#">gallery of cat pictures</a>, but for now this link just does nothing :3</p>
