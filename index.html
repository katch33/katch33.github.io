    <div><p class="blurb">This simple page contains a regular udpdate post about my coding and is otherwise devoted to my cat. The pictures are very high resolution, they are taken with a 24MP Sony A6300 and I think present a beautiful and adorable side of her. They can be opened in full resolution by right clicking or long pressing image and then choosing to either download/save the image or view it in a new tab in your browser.</p></div>

            **EDIT2**
        <br>
            I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart   about until tomorrow. Brain rest time.

            **EDIT1**
            <br>
            So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

            Day 2/100
            <br>
            Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to github!
