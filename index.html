        After several weeks of waiting the replacement fan for my T470 arrived! It turns out that without a spinning fan most laptops don't in fact want to boot up. Something to do with the high levels of heat and possible damage to the CPU or whatever. With my laptop now back to life it will be much easier to maintain this page again :p
        <br>
        While I have been maintaining some reading and youtube input about code my actual daily practice has fallen by the wayside. I have taken on the production work for a second podcast and spent the entire month of August working doggedly in the Axe Club. My manager is leaving, we have a new staff member and I am still responsible for our email correspondance and our booking managment. Come mid-September I will return to full time podcast work with the axe throwing taking up my Saturday's and Tuesday evenings.
        <br>
        My heightened sense of empowerment caused by both therpay and running my own blog style site here have meant I want to share my opinions more frequently. Please find some opinions blow.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>GAMES</h3>
        Recently I have been replaying all of the Metal Gear Solid games. I will write a bit more about the experience in the coming week or two but excitement around the Metal Gear Solid Delta remake of Snake Eater motivated me to go all in. I completed MGS2 and MGS3 within a couple of weeks and I'm currently playing MGS4 on PS3, alongside some MGS V on my steam deck.
        <br>
        Black Myth: Wukong was released finally to much positive review. I haven't had a chance to play it yet but given our financial goal of avoiding takeaways this month I should have some spare eurodollars lying around come payday so I will update about it soon.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>MUSIC</h3>
        Towards the end of September I will be heading to Paris to see Municipal Waste, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation and Schizophrenia all play together. I have been very excited to see Municiapl Waste again since their gig here last October. They have rapidly become one of my favourite bands. Energetic, obmoxious and motivating.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>TV</h3>
        TV is TV. Still watchin SWAT and Suits. I haven't watched anything else for a hiwle (bar many hours of MGS cutscenes and codec calls). One thing I want to do is try and increase my daily intake of anime. So far I've watched the first season of Delicious in Dungeon. Season 2's opening didn't quite do it for me, but the end of S1 was pretty mental.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>MOVIES</h3>
        Alien: Romulus was a worthy addition to the franchise's ever expanding list of movies about humans getting dead. I really liked it's adherence to the design language set up in the first movie and continued most strongly in the game Alien: Isolation.
        <br>
        Strong performances throughout helped carry a straightforward story of rugged industrial workers who uncover something much better left alone in a derelict space-station. A wonderful portrayal of Andy by David Jonsson helps to keep the tension high while the group do their best to survive an encounter with everyone's favourite Xenomorph.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>YOUTUBE</h3>
        I had a good time with Nakey Jakey's video about what constitutes a stealth game. I've also uncovered a fondness for Any Austin and his reviews of the river features in Skyrim/Zelda, his unemplyment surveys and his investigation into how accurate the power grid in GTA IV is.

    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>13/08/24</h2>
        Recently I have been watching two TV shows with regularity. Suits, the story of a con-man that goes from selling drugs and cheating on test for people to suddenly finding unethical people to be unpleasant and SWAT, a reimagining of the 1970's show of the same name.
        <br>
        <br>
        SWAT is in that space that glamourises and celebrates the tough no nonsense members of 20-David, a highly trained SWAT team of LAPD officers that "stay liquid" and deal with all manner of threats from terrorist plots to drug cartel violence, religious cult hostage situations and corrupt police.
        <br>
        They are led by Hondo, played with charming toughness by Shemar Moore of Criminal Minds fame and his second in command Deacon who is portrayed with handsome reliability by Jay Harrington.
        Also on the team are Street, Chris, Tan and Luca who each bring a likeable good-guy charm in their own way.
        <br>
        My issue here is the usual one. I love the concept of well trained people with good intentions protecting and serving. These SWAT officers are well funded, have great integrity and work under a chief that almost always wants to let them do the right thing. In the real world militarised police operating in a country laden with guns has the impact of upping the ante for everyone. For every bullet-proof wall destroying armoured vehicle the police buy that funding that is no longer availale for cities to train and employ people for services that might reduce the causes of crime in the first place. While it remains true that the world is safer than ever in many places the show never tries to meaningfully address the availability and use of weapons int he US. Luckily I watch it to shut my brain off and enjoy the tactical responses.
        <br>
        <br>
        Suits is entertaining as well, but sufferes from some writing that goes all over the place. The actors are great, each one playing their role very well. I have a particular fondness for Donna who is played with clear relish by Sarah Rafferty. It's always nice to watch someone who loves what they get to do for a living.
        <br>
        Everyone is aware of the presence of Meghan Markle in this show, a future Princess of England no less and the cast is lucky to feature Gina Torres in a commanding role as Jessica Pearson, one of the named partners at the law firm they work in.
        <br>
        The central conceit of the show is that Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) has an eidetic memory and can use this to always be right. I'm simplifying the effect it has but basically the show can always solve a problem by having Mike remember every single thing he has ever read in his life. He is brought into the law firm of Pearson and Hardman by Harvey Spectre, a fast talking and very succesful lawyer who takes a shine to Mike's eagerness to make something of himself after a near miss with some DEA agents over a suitcase that somehow is magically filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cannabis.
        <br>
        <br>
        The show is fun but the writing varies a lot. Sometimes the characters sound clever and engage in witty tete-a-tete style barbs. Other times they sound like how a school bully imagines a cool lawyer person might sound. My main problem with suits is that unlike a personal favourite of mine, Boston Legal, the characters aren't interesting enough to warrant being liked in spite of their moral ambiguity. At least in Boston Legal I was happy to let them break the law to save the salmon, or do the right thing. Here they are so bound to their egotistical views of themselves that for the professsionals at Pearson Hardman they only care about winning, not being right. And that doesn't feel fun to me.

        <h2>29/07/24</h2>
        I didn't have the opportunity to do any hands on coding over the last few days so instead I immersed myself in as much coding culture as I could. I chatted online, watched streams/videos and read articles. I forced myself to use the command line everytime I sat down at my computer and I loved every second of it. In fact I wanted to code, I wanted to be back at my computer, clicking and clacking and figuring things out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I spent most of today completing the "draw a cat" module and began the following module which is about creating piano keys that scale nicely with device width. I will update my brag page to match and accept that it's okay for me to balance my personal life and my work with this effort to learn a new skill. So long as I don't give up, I'm on the right path.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am now watching Suits for the first time. So far it's entertaining but it lacks some of the punch that I found in Boston Legal (one of my all time favourites). I tend to play games more than watch tv so it's often background distraction than something I focus too deeply on.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>26/07/24</h2>
        I have been out at my mother's housr visiting with family that are only here for a short while. Yesterday morning and the evening before (so the 24th and 25th) I pushed ahead with more work on freeCodeCamp and the "draw a cat with css" module. Tomorrow and Sunday are booked with travelling to visit family so I will have to post muy next update on Sunday evening/Monday. I will probably spend most of Monday afternoon/evening coding and post a more comprehensive update then.
        <br>
        <br>
        The most recent thing I watched was Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies and Cyberattacks. It's a netflix documentary about the extra-marital dating website's rise, it's hacking and some of the people that were affected by it all. I enjoyed it, probably something I would recommend to friends who have nothing else to watch, but I wouldn't worry about missing out on it.
        <br>
        <br>
        For music I have been listening to the album House of the Black Geminus by Akhlys and The Horrible Dissonance of Oblivion by KVADRAT. Both are black metal albums recommended to me by my cousin. Akhlys use long build ups and repetitive hypnotic riffs to build up huge dramatic soundscapes with excellent titles such as "The Maze of Phobetor", "Through The Abyssal Door" and the opening track "The Mask of Night Speaking".
        <br>
        KVADRAT is a one man project from Greece. I haven't finished listening to the album yet so I'm not reayd to launch into a critique but so far I like what I hear.
        <br>
        <br>
        In gaming news the long awaited Fallout London mod has FINALLY been released. A total conversion for Fallout 4, it was recently delayed when Bethesda released a patch to update the game for new users coming in from the tv show. That patch wasn't compatible with many of the mods used to create the fan project and so they needed to be updated before the massive fan project got back on track. You can watch a trailer for it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rahBCfRdVac" target="_blank">here</a>. To be totally honest calling it a fan project or a mod pack feels a bit unfair. The project has moved the entire thing to the UK, is fully voice acted and comes with it's own quests, stories, items companions, monsters etc. It should certainly scratch that itch that players have had since we got the stopgap of Fallout 76 :/
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>23/07/24</h2>
    I just realised I almost made it a full week with the daily updates on this page. That's alright given that upon
    careful examination, it seems I had very little to say. Luckily reading back through the posts has helped to clarify
    for me that the skill I really need to develop is consistency and discipline.
    <br>
    A larger weekly update and a regular daily update to my brag list are probably more manageable and achievable. I
    think that's the key here, to achieve something achievable. What a dream! I'm going to continue updating my site
    with my brags and listing what I do each day, but I'll update this main post page a bit more sporadically. I'll aim
    to talk about anything I find interesting or worthwhile but my suspicions is that if I expend focus and energy
    trying to fill space here I won't be coding as much as I could. The next few days have a lot of axe throwing and
    some visiting with family so I'm unlikely to post again until the weekend. Peace.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>22/07/24</h2>
    Over the last couple of days I have been extremely busy. The podcast I work on is winding down for the season and so
    my axe throwing work has taken over as my primary income. Because the podcast is done from the comfort of my lovely
    desktop computer I have a lot of time throughout the edges of my day to dip into coding and switch quickly from one
    focus to the other etc.
    <br>
    Alas while tremendous fun and deeply satisfying to do, throwing axes does demand more of my time to make up the same
    income. While updates may be less than daily (at least in terms of the main post here, the achievements page should
    be fine) they will continue. Ultimately what matters is that I continue to practice, continue to learn and
    eventually make enough money to hollow out the inside of a mountain/launch a rocket/inject myself with the blood of
    the young. The usual succesful person stuff!
    </p>

    <h2>19/07/24</h2>
    Today I focused on doing some excercises outside the confines of a tutorial. I took on the first challenge
    from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzuWIHGFKCQ&t=767s&pp=ygUMZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1w" target="_blank">this</a>
    video and managed to recreate the challenge button to a standard I was very
    happy with, I have linked to it on my brags page so that you can see it.
    <br>
    I also did some further reading on shells and building my own one. This led down a rabbit hole of reading
    about lisps and C programming and how to build your own language. It was all very educational.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lot's of reporting today on a <a
        href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/07/19/major-microsoft-outage-hits-users-worldwide-leading-to-cancelled-flights"
        target="_blank">major computer outage</a> worldwide today. A company called Crowdstrike released a
    security update with a bug in it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>18/07/24</h2>
    Invested my hour today into the FCC curriculum and completed about 84% of the CSS PSeudo Selectors Balance
    SHeet module. I had some work to do (still got to pay the bills while I become a l33t coding wiz).
    <br>
    I also tidied up all of my bookmarks in my browser and unsubscribed from a heap of emails and accounts. My
    theory is that if my computer environment is more streamlined it will be easier to focus on coding. I have
    settled on the default themes in VS Code (well tehcnically Code OSS with telemetry disabled) with some light
    transparency over a desktop wallpaper of Maxfield Parrish's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_%28painting%29" target="_blank">Daybreak</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Still working on different design ideas for this site. Simplicity is key, I want to nail my fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>17/07/24</h2>
    I completed the accessibility module on the FCC curriculum. Alongside that I opened an empty repo and
    practiced grid layouts and worked through a few tutorials and online examples. I don't want to burn out on
    this, so I am attempting to hit the minimum of one hour and then let myself focus on other things. If I am
    in the mood to contine coding practice I do so. Work may be delayed this week so I may not have anything to
    do for the next couple of days. That would allow me to focus entirely on coding if I have the motivation.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the next stage of this website I would like to add a page containing my pico 8 carts. In case you aren't
    familiar with it pico 8 is a fantasy console. It's a game editor and ide rolled into one and it's wat helped
    me make more sense of coding and become comfortable thinking programatically about solving issues. It can be
    found at <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com">lexaloffle.com</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    pico8 allows you to export html versions of your game, both as playable in browser standalone html files and
    embeddable files. I think github should allow me to host them here given how tiny they are. If not I have
    them on itch but it would be nice to get them on my own site as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>16/07/24</h2>
    This morning I did some coding on the train home. I completed a Fireship tutorial video about CSS grids
    which I pushed to my <a href="hhttps://github.com/katch33/css-playground">github</a>. After I made it home I
    completed another few lessons in the accessibility quiz module. I am trying to decide on a grid layout for
    my site. The adaptive picture gallery in the tutorial was great, and I think I'm going to update the gallery
    to that responsive style where pictures can grow and shrink. I need to set my menus up the same way. Likely
    a site redesign, but the updates will continue.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>15/07/24</h2>
    This morning I spent a few hours correcting some things on the site I wasn't happy with. I also added a
    gallery page which holds the images and their captions. I styled the social media and nav links a bit more
    consistently, and brought all the various background boxes in line from a padding and margin point of view.
    <br>
    <br>
    As usual I want to strip out a lot of my styling from the HTML and start over but we'll see. The focus is
    meant to be cat pictures and a daily post during my 100 days of code. If I can stick to that I would be
    pretty happy. I'll update this post if I get anymore done.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>14/07/24</h2>
    Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have
    fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that
    lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook
    everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to
    github!
    <br>
    <br>
    **EDIT1**
    <br>
    So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also
    managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them
    into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.
    <br>
    <br>
    **EDIT2**
    <br>
    I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until
    tomorrow. Brain rest time.
