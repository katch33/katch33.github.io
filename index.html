            Welcome to my personal website.
            <br>
            I'm katch33 and I am currently maintaining this site as I work through the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum. I highly recommend checking it if you are not sure where to get started in web development. The best way to learn is to start doing and understanding, at least it is for me! I decided to build my own website and experiment with ideas/designs here as I learn. My cat will feature throughout I suspect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each day I will make a post here and update my brag page. I amtaking part in the #100DaysOfCode

            Day 7 - 19/07/24
            <br>
            Today I focused on doing some excercises outside the confines of a tutorial. I took on the first challenge from  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzuWIHGFKCQ&t=767s&pp=ygUMZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1w" target="_blank">this</a> video and managed to recreate the challenge button to a standard I was very happy with, I have linked to it on my brags page so that you can see it.
            <br>
            I also did some further reading on shells and building my own one. This led down a rabbit hole of reading about lisps and C programming and how to build your own language. It was all very educational.
            <br>
            <br>
            News outlets have been reporting on a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/07/19/major-microsoft-outage-hits-users-worldwide-leading-to-cancelled-flights" target="_blank">major computer outage</a> worldwide today. It seems a security update pushed to production has blue screened tens of thousands of windows machines. I'll probably talk a bit more about it tomorrow.

            Day 6 - 18/07/24
            <br>
            Invested my hour today into the FCC curriculum and completed about 84% of the CSS PSeudo Selectors Balance SHeet module. I had some work to do (still got to pay the bills while I become a l33t coding wiz).
            <br>
            I also tidied up all of my bookmarks in my browser and unsubscribed from a heap of emails and accounts. My theory is that if my computer environment is more streamlined it will be easier to focus on coding. I have settled on the default themes in VS Code (well tehcnically Code OSS with telemetry disabled) with some light transparency over a desktop wallpaper of Maxfield Parrish's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_%28painting%29" target="_blank">Daybreak</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Still working on different design ideas for this site. Simplicity is key, I want to nail my fundamentals.

            Day 5/100 - 17/07/24
            <br>
            I completed the accessibility module on the FCC curriculum. Alongside that I opened an empty repo and practiced grid layouts and worked through a few tutorials and online examples. I don't want to burn out on this, so I am attempting to hit the minimum of one hour and then let myself focus on other things. If I am in the mood to ocntinue coding practice I do so. Work may be delayed this week so I may not have anything to do for the next couple of days. That would allow me to focus entirely on coding if I have the motivation.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the next stage of this website I would like to add a page containing my pico 8 carts. In case you aren't familiar with it pico 8 is a fantasy console. It's a game editor and ide rolled into one and it's wat helped me make more sense of coding and become comfortable thinking programatically about solving issues. It can be found at <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com">lexaloffle.com</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            pico8 allows you to export html versions of your game, both as playable in browser standalone html files and embeddable files. I think github should allow me to host them here given how tiny they are. If not I have them on itch but it would be nice to get them on my own site as well.

            Day 4/100 - 16/07/24
            <br>
            This morning I did some coding on the train home. I completed a Fireship tutorial video about CSS grids which I pushed to my <a href="hhttps://github.com/katch33/css-playground">github</a>. After I made it home I completed another few lessons in the accessibility quiz module. I am trying to decide on a grid layout for my site. The adaptive picture gallery in the tutorial was great, and I think I'm going to update the gallery to that responsive style where pictures can grow and shrink. I need to set my menus up the same way. Likely a site redesign, but the updates will continue.

            Day 3/100 - 15/07/24
            <br>
            This morning I spent a few hours correcting some things on the site I wasn't happy with. I also added a gallery page which holds the images and their captions. I styled the social media and nav links a bit more consistently, and brought all the various background boxes in line from a padding and margin point of view.
            <br>
            <br>
            As usual I want to strip out a lot of my styling from the HTML and start over but we'll see. The focus is meant to be cat pictures and a daily post during my 100 days of code. If I can stick to that I would be pretty happy. I'll update this post if I get anymore done.

            **EDIT2**
            <br>
            I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until
            tomorrow. Brain rest time.
            <br>

            **EDIT1**
            <br>
            So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also
            managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them
            into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

            Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have
            fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that
            lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook
            everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to
            github!
