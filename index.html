        <p class="current-article">Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to github!
        
        **EDIT** So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

        **EDIT2**
        I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until tomorrow. Brain rest time.
