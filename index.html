        <p class="blurb">This simple site contains a regular udpdate post on the homepage about my coding and is otherwise devoted to my
            cat. The pictures are usually 6000px X 4000px, a very high resolution. They are taken with a 24MP Sony A6300 and I think present a
            beautiful and adorable side of her. They can be opened in full resolution by right clicking or long pressing
            image and then choosing to either download/save the image or view it in a new tab in your browser.</p>

            Day 3/100 - 15/07/24
            <br>
            This morning I spent a few hours correcting some things on the site I wasn't happy with. I also added a gallery page which holds the images and their captions. I styled the social media and nav links a bit more consistently, and brought all the various background boxes in line from a padding and margin point of view.
            <br>
            <br>
            As usual I want to strip out a lot of my styling from the HTML and start over but we'll see. The focus is meant to be cat pictures and a daily post during my 100 days of code. If I can stick to that I would be pretty happy. I'll update this post if I get anymore done.

            **EDIT2**
            <br>
            I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until
            tomorrow. Brain rest time.

            **EDIT1**
            <br>
            So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also
            managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them
            into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

            Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have
            fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that
            lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook
            everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to
            github!
