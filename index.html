            Welcome to my website. Here I post (almost once a day when I can!), update my achievements
            list with whatever I got done for the day and host a gallery of pictures that I've taken (under
            construction). As I work through the freeCodeCamp curriculum and the 100-Days-Of-Code challenge I hope this
            page will grow and reflect my skills.

    <h2>23/07/24</h2>
    I just realised I almost made it a full week with the daily updates on this page. That's alright given that upon
    careful examination, it seems I had very little to say. Luckily reading back through the posts has helped to clarify
    for me that the skill I really need to develop is consistency and discipline.
    <br>
    A larger weekly update and a regular daily update to my brag list are probably more manageable and achievable. I
    think that's the key here, to achieve something achievable. What a dream! I'm going to continue updating my site
    with my brags and listing what I do each day, but I'll update this main post page a bit more sporadically. I'll aim
    to talk about anything I find interesting or worthwhile but my suspicions is that if I expend focus and energy
    trying to fill space here I won't be coding as much as I could. The next few days have a lot of axe throwing and
    some visiting with family so I'm unlikely to post again until the weekend. Peace.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>22/07/24</h2>
    Over the last couple of days I have been extremely busy. The podcast I work on is winding down for the season and so
    my axe throwing work has taken over as my primary income. Because the podcast is done from the comfort of my lovely
    desktop computer I have a lot of time throughout the edges of my day to dip into coding and switch quickly from one
    focus to the other etc.
    <br>
    Alas while tremendous fun and deeply satisfying to do, throwing axes does demand more of my time to make up the same
    income. While updates may be less than daily (at least in terms of the main post here, the achievements page should
    be fine) they will continue. Ultimately what matters is that I continue to practice, continue to learn and
    eventually make enough money to hollow out the inside of a mountain/launch a rocket/inject myself with the blood of
    the young. The usual succesful person stuff!

    <h2>19/07/24</h2>
    Today I focused on doing some excercises outside the confines of a tutorial. I took on the first challenge
    from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzuWIHGFKCQ&t=767s&pp=ygUMZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1w" target="_blank">this</a>
    video and managed to recreate the challenge button to a standard I was very
    happy with, I have linked to it on my brags page so that you can see it.
    <br>
    I also did some further reading on shells and building my own one. This led down a rabbit hole of reading
    about lisps and C programming and how to build your own language. It was all very educational.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lot's of reporting today on a <a
        href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/07/19/major-microsoft-outage-hits-users-worldwide-leading-to-cancelled-flights"
        target="_blank">major computer outage</a> worldwide today. A company called Crowdstrike released a
    security update with a bug in it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>18/07/24</h2>
    Invested my hour today into the FCC curriculum and completed about 84% of the CSS PSeudo Selectors Balance
    SHeet module. I had some work to do (still got to pay the bills while I become a l33t coding wiz).
    <br>
    I also tidied up all of my bookmarks in my browser and unsubscribed from a heap of emails and accounts. My
    theory is that if my computer environment is more streamlined it will be easier to focus on coding. I have
    settled on the default themes in VS Code (well tehcnically Code OSS with telemetry disabled) with some light
    transparency over a desktop wallpaper of Maxfield Parrish's <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_%28painting%29" target="_blank">Daybreak</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Still working on different design ideas for this site. Simplicity is key, I want to nail my fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>17/07/24</h2>
    I completed the accessibility module on the FCC curriculum. Alongside that I opened an empty repo and
    practiced grid layouts and worked through a few tutorials and online examples. I don't want to burn out on
    this, so I am attempting to hit the minimum of one hour and then let myself focus on other things. If I am
    in the mood to contine coding practice I do so. Work may be delayed this week so I may not have anything to
    do for the next couple of days. That would allow me to focus entirely on coding if I have the motivation.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the next stage of this website I would like to add a page containing my pico 8 carts. In case you aren't
    familiar with it pico 8 is a fantasy console. It's a game editor and ide rolled into one and it's wat helped
    me make more sense of coding and become comfortable thinking programatically about solving issues. It can be
    found at <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com">lexaloffle.com</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    pico8 allows you to export html versions of your game, both as playable in browser standalone html files and
    embeddable files. I think github should allow me to host them here given how tiny they are. If not I have
    them on itch but it would be nice to get them on my own site as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>16/07/24</h2>
    This morning I did some coding on the train home. I completed a Fireship tutorial video about CSS grids
    which I pushed to my <a href="hhttps://github.com/katch33/css-playground">github</a>. After I made it home I
    completed another few lessons in the accessibility quiz module. I am trying to decide on a grid layout for
    my site. The adaptive picture gallery in the tutorial was great, and I think I'm going to update the gallery
    to that responsive style where pictures can grow and shrink. I need to set my menus up the same way. Likely
    a site redesign, but the updates will continue.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>15/07/24</h2>
    This morning I spent a few hours correcting some things on the site I wasn't happy with. I also added a
    gallery page which holds the images and their captions. I styled the social media and nav links a bit more
    consistently, and brought all the various background boxes in line from a padding and margin point of view.
    <br>
    <br>
    As usual I want to strip out a lot of my styling from the HTML and start over but we'll see. The focus is
    meant to be cat pictures and a daily post during my 100 days of code. If I can stick to that I would be
    pretty happy. I'll update this post if I get anymore done.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>14/07/24</h2>
    Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have
    fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that
    lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook
    everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to
    github!
    <br>
    <br>
    **EDIT1**
    <br>
    So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also
    managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them
    into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.
    <br>
    <br>
    **EDIT2**
    <br>
    I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until
    tomorrow. Brain rest time.
