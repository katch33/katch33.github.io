            Welcome to my personal custom built website. This site has two primary functions. First it is a demonstration of my skills as I become a better coder and second it is an evolving and loving devotion to my fierce and beautiful companion SC. You can read the daily update below, you can find my links up above. I hope you enjoy the pictures! - katch33

            Day 4/100 - 16/07/24
            <br>
            This morning I did some coding on the train home. I completed a Fireship tutorial video about CSS grids which I pushed to my <a href="hhttps://github.com/katch33/css-playground">github</a>. After I made it home I completed another few lessons in the accessibility quiz module. I am trying to decide on a grid layout for my site. The adaptive picture gallery in the tutorial was great, and I think I'm going to update the gallery to that responsive style where pictures can grow and shrink. I need to set my menus up the same way. Likely a site redesign, but the updates will continue.

            Day 3/100 - 15/07/24
            <br>
            This morning I spent a few hours correcting some things on the site I wasn't happy with. I also added a gallery page which holds the images and their captions. I styled the social media and nav links a bit more consistently, and brought all the various background boxes in line from a padding and margin point of view.
            <br>
            <br>
            As usual I want to strip out a lot of my styling from the HTML and start over but we'll see. The focus is meant to be cat pictures and a daily post during my 100 days of code. If I can stick to that I would be pretty happy. I'll update this post if I get anymore done.

            **EDIT2**
            <br>
            I completed the Typography course module in the FCC Curriculum! A productive day, now to fart about until
            tomorrow. Brain rest time.

            **EDIT1**
            <br>
            So I finally figured out how to add and commit changes and how to push them to the remote repository. I also
            managed to get some photo's of my lovely feline housemate uploaded for your enjoyment. I will arrange them
            into a gallery soon. For now my plan is to update my README file I think.

            Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have
            fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that
            lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook
            everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to
            github!
