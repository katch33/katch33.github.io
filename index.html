        <p>Okay so I made biscuits today. I found out that all I need is butter, flour and sugar. I didn't even have fine sugar and they still worked out well. My life feels a bit different, like there are two me's. One that lived before I learned how to make biscuits, and a genuinely good person who wants to learn to cook everyone's favourite biscuits. Maybe some pics to follow if I figure out how to push these changes to github!</p>
