        <p class="blurb">The gallery of images below is made up of the best photo's of my feline friend that I have taken. The full original images are 6000 x 4000px and weight in close to 10mb each. By reducing the image resolution down to 5400 x 3600px I was able to bring the image size down to about 2mb per picture. It also sped up the page loading time. I may lower the file size further although I like the images being available in a beautiful high resolution format.</p>

        <img src="images/best_pic.JPG" alt="A really nice portrait landscape photo of a cat">
        <div class="caption-bg">
            <p class="caption">This is a probably the best photo I will ever take. I am low down, she's paused, head
                raised. Her eyes and nose are beautifullly focused catching her in a candid moment of focus transfixed
                by the trees above. I love this picture.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/bigstretch.JPG" alt="A photo of a cat just stretching after it gets up from a nap">
        <p class="caption caption-bg">Here she had just woken up and partially stretched up, she turned and in the
            natural light her messy thick fur just looked very impressive. I couldn't help but take some pictures of her
            as always. This is one that really makes her look soft.</p>
        <img src="images/litwell.JPG" alt="A dramatically lit close up photo of a cat">
        <p class="caption caption-bg">Strong backlighting creates this playful shadow across her face here, it
            accentuates the roundness of her forms in a way that front lighting can't. I had never seen this aspect of
            her before and luckliy the camera was nearby. So cute <3 </p>
                <img src="images/hunter.JPG" alt="A picture of a cat looking reminiscent of a large hunting cat">
                <p class="caption caption-bg">In this photo you can clearly see her ancestry as a large hunting animal.
                    Powerful muscles and fully intentioned motion combine to convey a sense of predatory focus. I love
                    this picture of her as it reminds me that no matter how cute I think she is, her kind would menace
                    us dreadfully if they were bigger.</p>
                <img src="images/lick.JPG" alt="A close up of a cat licking her paw">
                <p class="caption caption-bg">Another very close up portrait shot, this time she playfully reclines in
                    the sunshine licking her paws with carefree indulgence. When the light is good it really brightens
                    her white fur and contrasts the darker patches beautifully. This was another siuation where a candid
                    model and great natural light did all the work.</p>
                <p>Soon there will be a link to my <a href="#">gallery of cat pictures</a>, but for now this link just
                    does nothing :3</p>
